    Component &quot;ButtonB3&quot; should be enabled

    After selecting &#39;Human vs Robot&#39;, the game should start. The first player button should be set to &#39;Robot&#39; and disabled. The second player button should be set to &#39;Human&#39; and disabled. The Start/Reset button should be set to &#39;Reset&#39; and the cells should be enabled.
